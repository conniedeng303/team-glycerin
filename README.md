## Project Highlights  üí´
- Key takeaways from the project  
- Interesting findings or breakthroughs  
- Unique approaches or innovations implemented

Throughout the project, our team explored multiple deep learning architectures to develop a robust dermatology classification model. We initially experimented with various pre-trained models, including DenseNet201, CNNs, MobileNet, MobileNetV3, Xception, ResNet, and InceptionV3. Each model was assessed for accuracy and generalization capability, with InceptionV3 ultimately proving to be the most effective. A key takeaway from our work was the significant impact of data augmentation in improving model performance. By applying transformations such as rotation, zoom, brightness adjustments, noise injection, and gaussian blur, we were able to enhance the model‚Äôs ability to generalize across diverse skin tones and conditions. This iterative experimentation allowed us to optimize our final submission and achieve a competitive accuracy score.

One of the most interesting breakthroughs in our project was the realization that certain augmentation techniques had a more pronounced effect on model accuracy than others. For instance, downsizing images (tested with DenseNet201) did not yield a major improvement, whereas transformations like zooming, rotation, and shifting (applied to InceptionV3) significantly boosted performance. Additionally, despite attempts to utilize synthetic data generation techniques such as SMOTE, computational limitations prevented us from leveraging these methods effectively. Through meticulous testing of augmentation techniques, we discovered that a well-balanced combination of transformations was crucial to maximizing accuracy while avoiding overfitting.

Our approach was unique in that we not only focused on optimizing a single model but also systematically analyzed how different architectures performed under various augmentation strategies. By integrating findings from different models, we fine-tuned InceptionV3 using insights gained from previous experiments. Additionally, we tackled submission formatting issues to ensure compatibility with the Kaggle evaluation system, a crucial step in obtaining valid results. Our work highlights the importance of iterative refinement, leveraging diverse models, and strategically applying augmentation to enhance performance in dermatology AI applications.

## Project Overview üëÄ
This Kaggle competition, part of the **Break Through Tech AI Program**, challenges teams to develop an inclusive **machine learning model** for dermatology. The competition is hosted by the **Algorithmic Justice League (AJL)** and brings together AI Fellows from the Virtual, Boston (MIT), and Los Angeles (UCLA) programs.  

### üéØ **Objective**  
Our goal is to **train an AI model that accurately classifies 16 skin conditions across diverse skin tones** using the provided dataset. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to improve dermatology AI tools that historically struggle with underrepresented skin types.  

### üåç **Real-World Impact**  
Dermatology AI models often **underperform for people with darker skin tones** due to **biased training data**, leading to **misdiagnosis and health disparities**. By addressing these biases, our work can:  
‚úÖ **Improve diagnostic accuracy** for diverse populations  
‚úÖ **Reduce healthcare inequities** caused by AI bias  
‚úÖ **Advance fairness and transparency in AI systems**  

This project contributes to ongoing research in **ethical AI** and supports efforts to build more **inclusive, trustworthy AI models** in healthcare.

## Model Development  üîß
We initially experimented with various pre-trained models, including Inception, MobileNetV1 and V3, ResNet, and EfficientNet. Among them, Inception demonstrated the best out-of-the-box performance. Following this, our focus shifted primarily to testing different data augmentations (rotations, hues, brightness, etc.) with varying probabilities of application. Data augmentation provided to be the most useful at getting our score, for example, we created functions that created cutouts and noise injections within the images, which prevents the model from overfitting and helped us reach our final score

We also explored modifications at the architectural level, such as incorporating dropout to help regularize the model by preventing neurons from co-adapting too strongly. As we encountered increasing issues with overfitting, we expanded our model selection and experimented with different activation functions. Additionally, we reviewed recent machine learning research in dermatology to replicate useful methodologies‚Äîthough not exactly, as many papers are tailored to specific skin conditions and do not always address our particular challenges.

One of the significant challenges we faced was the limited computational resources available on Colab. For instance, we attempted to generate synthetic images using SMOTE and GANs, but Colab's constraints prevented us from executing these techniques effectively.
