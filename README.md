## Project Overview üëÄ
This Kaggle competition, part of the **Break Through Tech AI Program**, challenges teams to develop an inclusive **machine learning model** for dermatology. The competition is hosted by the **Algorithmic Justice League (AJL)** and brings together AI Fellows from the Virtual, Boston (MIT), and Los Angeles (UCLA) programs.  

### üéØ **Objective**  
Our goal is to **train an AI model that accurately classifies 16 skin conditions across diverse skin tones** using the provided dataset. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to improve dermatology AI tools that historically struggle with underrepresented skin types.  

### üåç **Real-World Impact**  
Dermatology AI models often **underperform for people with darker skin tones** due to **biased training data**, leading to **misdiagnosis and health disparities**. By addressing these biases, our work can:  
‚úÖ **Improve diagnostic accuracy** for diverse populations  
‚úÖ **Reduce healthcare inequities** caused by AI bias  
‚úÖ **Advance fairness and transparency in AI systems**  

This project contributes to ongoing research in **ethical AI** and supports efforts to build more **inclusive, trustworthy AI models** in healthcare.
